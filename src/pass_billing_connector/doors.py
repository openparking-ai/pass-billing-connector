"""The two command lines, and nothing else.

**THIS IS THE WHOLE OF THE CONNECTOR'S CONTACT WITH EITHER MODULE.** Every read
and every write goes through ``garage-pass`` or ``monthly-billing`` run as a
subprocess, with the environment the operator gave the connector passed through
untouched -- the modules read their own DSNs (``GARAGE_PASS_DSN``,
``MONTHLY_BILLING_DSN``) from it; the connector never does. It imports neither
package, opens no connection, and holds no DSN. Each module keeps its own
transaction boundary and its own row security, and the connector is "the same
door everyone else uses". ``tests/test_c3_...`` enforces that from the source
with a planted import as its control, not from this docstring.

**WHAT IS READ FROM EACH MODULE, PINNED.** Measured at the commits
``pyproject.toml`` pins, and re-measured by the tests against those commits so
a change there reddens this repository's CI rather than silently mis-parsing:

garage-pass (``show-pass --tenant T --garage G --pass-id P``)
  exit 0, JSON on stdout: ``pass``, ``state``, ``valid_from``, ``valid_to``,
  ``garages``, ``garages_not_named``, ``unreadable``, ``unreadable_garages``,
  ``registrations`` (each ``vehicle_identity``, ``garage``, ``effective_day``,
  ``end_day``, ``ended_reason``). A refusal is JSON on stdout
  (``{"refused": code, "field": ..., "detail": ...}``), exit 3. The machine's
  configuration is a sentence on stderr, exit 2.

monthly-billing (``show-register --tenant T --agreement A``)
  exit 0, JSON on stdout, nine keys: ``agreement``, ``version``, ``registrar``,
  ``status``, ``cancelled_effective_day``, ``home_garage``, ``covered_garages``,
  ``registrations`` (each ``garage``, ``identity_normalised``),
  ``garages_not_covered``. A refusal or NOT FOUND is a sentence on stderr,
  exit 2 (``REFUSED — <code>: ...`` or ``NOT FOUND — ...``). No DSN is a
  sentence and exit 1; a DSN that does not connect is the driver's own
  traceback, exit 1 -- both read here as configuration.

monthly-billing (``register-vehicle --tenant T --agreement A --vehicle V --at I``
and ``release-vehicle --tenant T --agreement A --vehicle V --garage G``)
  exit 0, a first line saying what was done, then ONE LINE PER GARAGE THE
  CALL REACHED, exactly ``  at garage {garage id}: {stored form}``
  (``cli.py:365`` at the pinned commit): every covered garage for a register,
  the ONE named garage for a release. That line is the one piece of prose the
  connector relies on, and ``STORED_FORM_LINE`` pins its spelling. It is
  matched against the garage ids the register read already named -- the
  garage is a known string, so the form after it may contain anything, ``: ``
  included. A line naming no known garage is unparseable and is reported as
  such, never guessed at.

  **Every release names its garage.** ``release-vehicle`` without ``--garage``
  releases by identity at EVERY covered garage under each garage's own rule
  (measured at the pinned commit): passing a stale exact-rule form back would
  also take the live folded-rule row that spells the same at another garage.
  With ``--garage G`` the door normalises the text under G's rule and deletes
  at G alone, so a stored form passed back at the garage that stored it takes
  exactly that row. The connector never calls the door's fan-out.

  **An ambiguous covered set is refused before the line is read.** When one
  covered id is another covered id plus the separator plus anything (``g`` and
  ``g: 2``), a line ``  at garage g: 2: x1`` has two readings and no parser can
  tell them apart; ``ambiguous_garage_ids`` names such pairs and the link is
  refused before any write, so the parser is never asked that question.
