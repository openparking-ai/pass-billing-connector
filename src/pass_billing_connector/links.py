"""The links document: every link STATED, never inferred.

A link is a pass on one side and an outside-registrar agreement on the other,
in two databases that share no key. The only common ground between them is
text -- a garage's external id, a pass id, an agreement id -- and the connector
never guesses a link from matching text. Somebody writes it down, here.

    {"links": [
      {"pass_tenant": "<uuid>", "pass_id": "pass-1", "pass_garage": "garage-a",
       "billing_tenant": "<uuid>", "agreement_id": "ag-1"}
    ]}

``pass_garage`` is an ACCESS KEY, not a scope: it is the ``--garage`` every
garage-pass store call takes, and garage-pass refuses a garage the pass does
not name (its G25). The connector compares the pass's WHOLE garage set with
the agreement's covered set (``sync.py``); the garage named here decides
nothing about which garages are reconciled.

Unknown keys are refused, a missing key is refused, a pass or an agreement
appearing in two links is refused -- each by name, before anything is read
from either module. The connector has no database: this document is the whole
of what it knows.
