"""The report: one JSON document, sorted keys, every link with every action
and every finding by name.

**THE KEY SET IS DERIVED FROM THESE CLASSES AND IS CLOSED.** ``docs/CONTRACT.md``
lists the keys from the dataclass fields; a key the contract does not list
cannot be emitted without changing a class here, and the test that plants one
requires the contract to change with it. Every key is present on every
instance -- a field that does not apply is ``null`` -- so the shape a reader
parses is the same shape every run.

**NOTHING PERSONAL TRAVELS.** Ids, garages, days, identities and stored forms:
that is the whole of it. ``show-pass`` already carries no holder, label or
term beyond the two valid days, and nothing here adds a field the reads did
not return.
