"""One link, one run: registers first, releases by stored form, the verdict
from the final read.

THE ORDER, AND WHY.

1. **Read both, and refuse the link -- writing nothing -- on anything that
   makes "equal" undefined**: a registrar that is not `outside`, garage sets
   that differ, a pass or garage stored unreadable, rows outside either set,
   a covered set whose ids the door's printed line cannot tell apart (one id
   is another plus `: ` plus anything). Each refusal is a finding by name; a
   module that would not answer the read is a finding carrying the module's
   own words.

2. **Register every live identity** (``live.py``), as garage-pass recorded it,
   through ``register-vehicle`` -- idempotent at the door: a row already this
   agreement's is left and its stored form still printed. The printed form
   per garage is COLLECTED, and it is the only source of a stored form the
   connector ever has. The connector never reimplements billing's
   normalisation; the door's answer is the whole of what it knows about forms.

3. **A collision stops the releases -- and so does a register the door did
   not answer.** Two live identities with one stored form at one garage (the
   folded rule makes `AB-123` and `ab123` one billing row): releasing either
   would take out the other, so nothing is released for the link, it does not
   converge, and the report names the garage, the form and both identities.
   And a live identity whose ``register-vehicle`` did not come back ``done``
   -- refused, failed, or an answer the connector cannot read -- has no known
   forms, so every row billing may already hold for it would look stale.
   The connector cannot tell "the car is not registered" from "the door did
   not tell me", and an incomplete picture of the desired set is never a
   licence to delete: nothing is released for the link that run, the
   registers that did answer stand, ``STORED_FORM_UNKNOWN`` names the identity
   and the door's words, the link does not converge, and the next run
   re-reads. (Measured before this rule existed: one transient failure on a
   held car's register released that car's rows at every garage.) A
   ``refused`` register -- the door's exit 2, a car held by ANOTHER
   agreement -- is not transient: it stands until an operator moves the car,
   and until then this link releases nothing on every run, loudly (exit 1,
   the finding, the identity, the door's words). That is this rule holding,
   not a fault of the connector's: it cannot tell a held car from a door that
   did not answer, and deletes nothing on either.

4. **Release by stored form, never by raw identity, AT THE GARAGE THAT
   STORES IT.** Every row billing holds at a garage whose form is not among
   step 2's forms at that garage is released by passing that form back to
   ``release-vehicle --garage`` naming that garage. That relies on billing's
   normalisation being idempotent -- ``n(n(x)) == n(x)`` -- which was measured
   at the pinned commit over every code point under every rule before this
   was built, and which ``tests/test_c7_...`` measures again at the door.

   **AND THE GARAGE IS ALWAYS NAMED.** The door's unnamed release takes ONE
   identity and releases it at EVERY covered garage under each garage's own
   rule -- so releasing a stale exact-rule form `ab123` at garage B would also
   release the live folded-rule row `ab123` at garage A, which is `AB-123`'s,
   and the car would be uncovered at A until it was registered again.
   Measured at the pinned commit, not reasoned about. Naming the garage
   (billing's G46) takes the one row and no other, so no release of this
   connector's ever takes a live car's row, and there is no window to state.

5. **Read both again. The verdict is the final read.** Billing's rows, as
   (garage, form), against every live identity's forms from the door's
   answers. A difference either way is a DIVERGENCE, per garage, per form,
   naming the side that holds it; a live identity whose registration the
   door refused has no known form and cannot converge; a pass that changed
   under the run is named; an identity live at some of the pass's garages
   and not at others is named (``PASS_REGISTER_ASYMMETRIC``) and does not
   converge, because the door registers everywhere or nowhere and the
   identity-set comparison alone would call it equal. A row billing holds
   that no KNOWN form accounts for, while some live identity's form is
   unknown, may be that identity's:
   its sentence names the identities whose forms the run does not know and
   does not call the row foreign -- the report claims nothing the run could
   not learn. **And step 1's refusals are checked again against
   the final reads**: a registrar, a garage set, an unreadable record, a row
   outside a set or an ambiguous id that changed under the run is named
   exactly as it would be at the start of a run, and the link does not
   converge -- "equal" that became undefined during the run is not called
   equal at its end. Every register and release the run made is in the
   report with its reason and the door's own words.

THE CROSS-DATABASE FAILURE STATE IS CONVERGENCE. The two writes are never one
transaction. Nothing here survives between runs, so a run killed half-way is
repaired by the next run from fresh reads, and no state of the connector's
can go stale. Two runs over one link at once are NOT serialised by the
connector; the operator runs one at a time per link, and a run whose final
read disagrees exits 1.
