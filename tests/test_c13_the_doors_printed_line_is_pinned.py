"""C13 -- the door's printed line is pinned.

`  at garage {garage}: {form}` is the one piece of prose the connector reads.
It is matched against garage ids the register read already named, so the
form after the garage may contain anything -- `: ` included -- and a line
naming no known garage makes the whole answer unparseable rather than
half-read.

THE ONE SHAPE NO PARSER CAN READ. With covered ids `g` and `g: 2`, the line
`  at garage g: 2: x1` is garage `g` storing `2: x1` AND garage `g: 2`
storing `x1`, byte for byte. The parser's longest-first order picks one, and
for a release that printed one such line the pick is a guess. So a covered
set in which one id is another id plus the separator plus anything is
refused before any write (`GARAGE_IDS_AMBIGUOUS`, the pure half here and
the real world in `test_c11_...`), and the parser is never asked.

The database half runs the real door at the pinned commit and asserts the
exact lines, so a change there reddens this repository before it mis-parses.
