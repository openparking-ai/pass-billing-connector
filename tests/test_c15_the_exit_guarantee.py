"""C15 -- the exit guarantee.

The connector touches registrations only. Its subprocess calls are exactly
four verbs -- read from `doors.py`'s source; its own command line has one
verb, `sync`; no key of its report could deny an exit; and garage-pass's own
access answer at a lane is the same before and after a run. Nothing here can
trap a car in a garage.
