"""The canonical registry of what this module guarantees.

**ONE SOURCE, THREE CONSUMERS.** ``conftest.py`` requires every registered id to
have RUN; ``scripts/fail_controls.py`` requires every registered id to have a
control PROVEN TO FAIL and refuses to run if one has none; ``docs/CONTRACT.md``
is generated from this file. A guarantee therefore cannot be quietly dropped from
any of the three, and a number of them cannot go stale in a comment, because
nothing types the number anywhere.

**A GUARANTEE IS A SENTENCE SOMEBODY COULD ACT ON.** Not "the connector
validates the links document" -- that is a mechanism. "A pass appearing in two
links is refused before anything is read" is a claim with a failing case, and
the failing case is what the control plants.
