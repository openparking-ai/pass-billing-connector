"""C14 -- nothing personal travels.

Every fixture pass carries a holder -- a name, an `example.com` address, a
phone -- because the product's passes do. None of it reaches `show-pass`
(garage-pass's G26), so none of it can reach the report; and this test
renders a report from such a pass and looks, rather than trusting either
sentence. The key set is closed (C12); this is the check on the VALUES.
