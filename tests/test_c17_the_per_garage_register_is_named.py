"""C17 -- the per-garage register is compared, or it is named.

The run compares billing's rows with the pass's live IDENTITY SET rendered
through the door's per-garage forms (`expected`), and the door registers a
car at every covered garage or at none. So a pass holding a car live at some
of its garages and not at others -- a picture billing cannot be made to hold
-- converged before this guarantee existed: exit 0, no finding, while billing
covered the car at a garage the pass does not, and garage-pass's own lane at
that garage answered not covered. Measured in the outside round's L3 (538 of
1,808 converged fuzz runs with asymmetric passes).

Now it is named from the final read: `PASS_REGISTER_ASYMMETRIC`, the
identity, the garages that hold it and the garages that do not; the link
does not converge; nothing is registered or released on the strength of it;
`expected` and the divergence lines are untouched (the L3's property
`converged => billing == expected` still holds -- the finding is a new
conjunct, not a rebuilt expectation).

THE STATE IS NOT REACHABLE THROUGH GARAGE-PASS'S OWN VERBS at the pinned
commit: a registration is written at every garage of the pass or none, an
ending frees the identity at every garage, and `revoked` -- the one state
that writes per-garage end days -- is terminal. The database test therefore
seeds it the way the L3 did, with a raw DELETE of one garage's row as the
owner, and says so here rather than pretending a door produced it.
