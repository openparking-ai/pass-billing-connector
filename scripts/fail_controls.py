"""Every guarantee, proven able to FAIL.

A test that has never failed is a decoration. For each registered guarantee this
script breaks the thing the guarantee guards, runs that guarantee's tests in a
fresh interpreter, and requires them to go RED. If a test stays green with its
subject broken, it was not measuring its subject and this script says so.

    python scripts/fail_controls.py            # every control
    python scripts/fail_controls.py G2 G9      # a subset
    python scripts/fail_controls.py --anchors  # anchors only, in a second

**The anchor pre-flight.** ``--anchors`` counts every plant's ``from`` string in
its file without running a single test. An anchor is a string in a source file,
and editing the line it sits on silently retires the control that depends on it --
a sibling repository in this project had five dead controls killed exactly that
way, by a fix round that edited the anchor lines and reported the result as
controls that worked. The pre-flight answers that whole failure mode in a second
where the full run takes a minute, and run against an older tree it is its own
positive control.

**Restores are written back, never `git checkout`.** Each plant is a context
manager whose ``finally`` writes the original bytes and verifies them. `checkout`
has been broken twice on this project and would take a co-resident session's
uncommitted work with it.

**AND A CONTROL THAT REPORTS UNMEASURED IS REPORTING ON THE RUNNER.** If a target
is already red before anything is planted, or ran no tests at all, this says
UNMEASURED rather than counting a pass -- because a suite that cannot run cannot
tell you whether a control fired. Check the runner (is the package installed? is
a database reachable for the ones that need one?) before reading anything into
the subject.

**A TARGET WHOSE TESTS ALL SKIP IS REPORTED "NOT A CONTROL", NOT UNMEASURED, AND
THAT IS THIS SCRIPT'S OWN LIMIT RATHER THAN A JUDGEMENT.** `_NOTHING_RAN` matches
"0 passed", "no tests ran" and "collected 0 items"; an all-skipped target prints
none of those -- it prints "8 skipped" -- so the run proceeds, the target stays
green with its subject broken, and the verdict is DEAD. That is what happens to
a database-backed control on a machine with no database. The exit status is 1 either way, so nothing
goes falsely green; the word is simply the wrong one, and it is recorded here
rather than in a comment that promises otherwise. Read a DEAD verdict on a
database-backed control as "check whether you gave it a database" first.
